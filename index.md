## Welcome!

I am Yiyang Chang, currently working as a Researcher in System and Networking
at [Bytedance Inc](https://www.bytedance.com/), Seattle. I received my Ph.D. from
School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Purdue
University](https://www.purdue.edu/). Boiler up!  My Ph.D. advisor is Prof.
[Sanjay Rao](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~sanjay/). Prior to that, I
received my B.S. from School of EECS at Peking University in Beijing, China.

My research interests lie in Computer Systems and Networking. I have been
working on traffic engineering, network validation and synthesis, cloud
computing, and distributed SDN controller design. My
[Ph.D. dissertation](https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/Ensuring_Network_Designs_Meet_Performance_Requirements_under_Failures/8317076)
is about formally validating network designs to meet performance requirements
under failures.
