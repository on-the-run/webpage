## Welcome!

I am Yiyang Chang, currently working as a Researcher in System and Networking
at [ByteDance Inc](https://bytedance.com/en), Seattle. I received my Ph.D. from
School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Purdue
University](http://www.purdue.edu/). Boiler up!  My Ph.D. advisor is Prof.
[Sanjay Rao](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~sanjay/).

My research interests generally lie in Computer Systems and Networking. I have
done research in network validation and synthesis, cloud computing, and
distributed SDN controller design during my Ph.D. career. My dissertation
focuses on building a general framework for validating network designs.

Before coming to Purdue, I received my B.S. from School of EECS at Peking
University in Beijing, China.
