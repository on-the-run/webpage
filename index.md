## Welcome!
I am Yiyang Chang, currently a 5th year Ph.D. in School of Electrical and
Computer Engineering at [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu/). Boiler up!
My advisor is Prof. [Sanjay Rao](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~sanjay/).

My research interets generally lie in the area of computer networks and
distributed systems. I have done research in network validation and synthesis,
cloud computing, SDN distributed controller design, etc. I am currently
focusing on building a general framework for validating network designs.

Before coming to Purdue, I received my B.S. from School of EECS at Peking
University in Beijing, China.
